	<h3 id="starting_merlin">Starting Merlin</h3>

	<p>Once installed, Merlin can be invoked in your shell of choice by simply typing <code>merlin</code> and hitting return.</p>
	
	<p>You should then be greeted by a comma and blinking cursor. Something like:</p>
	
	<pre><code>
	$ merlin
	, |
	</code></pre>

	<h3 id="stack_manipulation">Stack Manipulation</h3>

	<p>First, we can start out by typing some text and hitting enter.</p>

	<pre><code>
	, hello, merlin!
	, |
	</code></pre>

	<p>Now, what exactly did this do? Well, Merlin will automatically start in its <code>atom</code> mode, so in this case typing <code>hello, merlin!</code> will first add <code>hello,</code> and then <code>merlin!</code> to the <i>stack</i>. The <i>stack</i>, in Merlin, is a global list of data, or pieces of text, called <i>atoms</i>. To view the stack, we can use the <code>molecule</code> command like so:</p>

	<pre><code>
	, ;molecule
	hello, merlin!
	, |
	</code></pre>

	<p>Take note that commands in Merlin are prefixed with a semicolon, to distinguish them from atoms. If you would like to add an atom beginning with a semicolon to the stack, you can prefix it with a backslash (\).</p>
	
	<p>Now, what if we would like to switch the order of these two atoms? We can use the <code>orbit</code> command.</p>

	<pre><code>
	, ;orbit ;molecule
	merlin! hello,
	, |
	</code></pre>

	<p>There we go! Now the order of the two atoms have been reversed. Again, take note that just like you can add two atoms to the stack on the same line, you can also run two commands.</p>

	<p>Of course if you can add atoms, you must also be able to remove them. You can do so with the <code>decay</code> command.</p>

	<pre><code>
	, ;decay ;molecule
	merlin!
	, |
	</code></pre>

	<p>You can also clear the entire stack using <code>destroy</code>:</p>

	<pre><code>
	, ;destroy ;molecule
	, |
	</code></pre>

	<p>Often you will need to view the last atom on the stack, that can be done with <code>pen</code>.</p>

	<pre><code>
	, hello world
	, ;pen
	world, |
	</code></pre>

	<p>Well would you look at that, <code>pen</code> doesn't append a newline! If you would like to use a newline anywhere in Merlin, you can use <code>new</code>. Although it is formatted like a command, all it really does is add a newline to the stack. Think of it being like <code>\n</code> in C derived programming languages.</p>

	<p>So, if we wanted to print the last atom on the stack, followed by a newline we could do something like:</p>

	<pre><code>
	, ;pen ;new ;pen ;decay
	world
	, |
	</code></pre>

	<p>The <code>decay</code> is necessary for removing the newline we added to the stack.</p>

	<p>Another action that you will find is very commonly needed in Merlin is joining and splitting atoms on the stack. You can use the <code>tether</code> command to join all of the atoms by another atom.</p>

	<pre><code>
	, ;new ;tether
	, ;pen ;new ;pen ;decay
	hello
	world
	, |
	</code></pre>

	<p>Essentially, <code>tether</code> will take the last atom, intersplicing it between all of the previous atoms, creating a <i>new</i> atom.</p>

	<p><code>fray</code> works in a similar way. It takes the second to last atom and splits it into different atoms, using the last atom as the delimiter.</p>
	
	<pre><code>
	, ;new ;fray
	, ;molecule
	hello world
	, |
	</code></pre>

	<p>Finally, you can use the <code>atoms</code> command to get the number of atoms in the stack. This is useful for when you are dealing with empty ("") atoms.</p>

	<h3 id="nomens">Nomens</h3>

	<p>Now you have learned all of the ways you can manipulate the stack in Merlin! But still, many of these actions can be clunky to type out each time, that's where the <code>nomen</code> (short for nomenclature) command comes in.</p>
	
	<p>The <code>nomen</code> command captures all of the atoms in the stack, creating a new command, named by whatever the last atom of the stack was. Calling the "nomen" will "expand" to whatever the stack was when you defined it.</p>

	<p>If you wanted to create a nomen, <code>dispn</code>, to print the most recent item, appending a newline, and then removing the item from the stack, you would do:</p>

	<pre><code>
	, \;pen \;decay disp ;nomen
	, \;disp ;new \;disp dispn ;nomen
	, |
	</code></pre>

	<p>The first line defines the <code>disp</code> nomen to print the last item in a stack and then remove it. Notice that the commands are prefixed with a '\' in order to escape the commands' leading semicolons.</p>

	<p>The second line defines <code>dispn</code>. It calls our <code>disp</code> nomen by itself (therefore on the last item on the stack), and then on a newline</p>

	<p>This means that calling <code>Hello! ;dispn</code> would "expand" to:</p>

	<pre><code>
	Hello! ;disp ;new ;disp
	</code></pre>

	<p>And then:</p>

	<pre><code>
	Hello! ;pen ;decay ;new ;pen ;decay
	</code></pre>

	<p>Not only can you create nomens, but also delete and "clear" them. The <code>disenchant</code> command will take the name of a nomen and set it to do nothing. The nomen must be already be in memory. The <code>smash</code> will completely delete the nomen.</p>

	<p>The difference between the two commands is illustrated below:</p>

	<pre><code>
	, Hello! quark ;nomen
	, ;quark
	, ;molecule
	Hello!
	, quark ;disenchant
	, ;quark
	, ;molecule
	Hello!
	, quark ;smash
	, ;quark
	merlin: unknown command
	, |
	</code></pre>

	<h3 id="modes">Modes</h3>

	<p>Now that you know everything there is to know about stack manipulation and nomens in merlin, you can begin to learn about merlin's different modes</p>

	<p>
	As mentioned before, merlin defaults to being in the <code>atom</code> mode. In this mode each space-separated "atom" is parsed by itself, whether it be a string or a command.
	This differs from merlin's <code>scribe</code> mode (entered by simply using the <code>scribe</code> command) in which each line is parsed in it's whole.
	This means that entering <code>hello, world</code> will add the string in its entirety to the stack, not breaking it up into pieces like <code>atom</code> would.
	</p>

	<p>This concept is exemplified by the following example:</p>

	<pre><code>
	, ;scribe
	Hello, World!
	;dispn
	Hello, World
	;atom
	, |
	</code></pre>
